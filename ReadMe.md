Make sure to make your own key.py file and make your API_KEY="your api key" so this application can run properly. 

Project Description 

For our project we will be making a python-based application designed to analyze stock data by utilizing the Polygon.io API. The project will be using dynamic stock data with static datatsets stored in SQLite databases to provide financial insights of the stock of choice.

How Our Application Works
We will use our API keys generated from the provider which is Polygon.io. This API key will give us access to fecth data and allow us to fully run the application succesfully. We will input stock ticker, start date, and end date. This application can also chart stocks by entering the following variables correctly. Then it's historical data price will be created on a database file and you can run SQLite codes simply to manipulate them. 


Key Points 
-Fetch historical data using Polygon.io API
-Analyze historical data such as price movements 
-Financial datasets based on stock history 
-Uses classes that will be able to be reused 
-Genereated graphs and charts to visualize stock price trends
